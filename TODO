[x] slider out of bounds display
	[-] red styling for knob (branch: oob)
[x] stop-propagation
	[-] captureKeys (stop-propagation-option)

internal
	[ ] get a linter that also deals w html, css/sass
	jsdoc and html plugins don't play nice
	there's a disable plugin, could turn off jsdoc plugin in html files
	and all of this also applies to markdown examples, so that's 4 eslint plugins...
	[-] get rid of all the -r esm
	standard-things/esm/issues/896 is the primary offender
	the experimental modules flag is kinda wack ... was slower than -r esm
	[x] dark scheme for homepage

[x] GUI.onFinishChange (branch: undo)
[x] ios negative numbers (branch: typenumber)
	the spec for inputmode=decimal doesn't mandate a negative sign
	only way to default to a keyboard with numbers, decimals and a negative sign
	on ios is with input[type=number]. i hate unstyling that thing

[-] -webkit-tap-highlight is still on boolean and option
	but there's no :active style on either without it (branch: mobileactivestates)

[-] button text-transform: none
	this was there to compensate for a very broad css selector in the three.js 
	examples while developing, shouldn't be there.
	well, in truth there's a bunch of 'resets' in the .lil-gui { selector too

[-] move --string-color and --number-color to inputs.scss

0.13

[-] test color malform/edge cases
	current behavior is fine imo, don't want to bloat it with error message strings
[x] test reset color arr/obj

[x] revert the change check in listen().
	i thought this was needed to keep controllers interactive because of
	a three.js example "webgl_clipping_advanced" -- there was a checkbox that is
	deliberately uncheckable and i thought listen() was causing this
	
[-] function controller on(finish)change?
[-] close() should accept a parameter like disable() for symmetry with open()
[x] onFinishChange on reset
[x] load should return this
[x] load should call onfinishchange

[-] mousewheel/slider key modifiers
	would require keeping track of a cumulative delta like vertical drag
[-] show()/hide(), ._hidden, hideKey: 'h' ?
	rarely find myself needing anything more than gui.domElement.style.display = 'none';

[x] better gui.add/addColor failure message
	too many ways addColor can fail, just gonna let it yell at you for now
[x] unit test for number box vertical drag

[x] number slider should blur input on mousewheel
[x] no more passive false

[x] i'd like to make it easier to find/view the built source.
	[x] @VERSION swapout for guide in cdn example
	[x] include version-dev (0.11.0-dev) in build comment if not on master
	[x] disable hotlinking to dist via .htaccess

[x] can't enter decimal numbers on ios (no . in numpad input)
[x] use (pointer: coarse) to apply mobile style?
[x] checkboxes should get the outline on focus
[x] horizontal mousewheel should work on sliders...
[x] folder :active style (for mob)
[x] folder focus style
[x] folder hover flashes during close transition?
[x] folder title hover
[x] lots of adjacent closed folders could use hr's (pixi)
[x] better color picker hover

[x] try binding a window / document touchmove listener on slider drag to squash mobile scrolling...
	(this seems to be working everywhere save threejs swap. i think it's the iframe? 
	still triggers weird safari address bar when sliding even if scroll is prevented)

three js pr revelations

[x] listen should only touch the dom if the value changes
[x] button enable/disable only changes appearance (not true, page had styles that break through)
[x] restore .controllers & .folders
[x] --title-text-color per langley

	[x] i don't like how some anchors are inside h1/2/3 and some aren't. if they're all above the 
		header in question i don't need --anchor offset. they only hafta be inside the header for .md
	[-] order of properties (not methods) in API is kinda wonky
		no it's not it's a-z$_
	[x] main api toc columns are ugly
	[x] !! update anchor positions on resize

sup i'm back it's 2021

[x] color picker hover

[x] button lost active color on mobile
[x] no hover on slider drag please

[x] listen() 0 - 1, slider knob stops moving around zero...

[x] no demo gui on mobile: annoying, conceals intro
[x] --hover-color should return...

[x] unit test for gui.onChange

[x] export should yell at you if you have collisions
[x] import should yell if you don't have .controllers

[x] gui.onChange
[x] themes dont work with new load export format

[x] massage API list/toc index: too scary looking

[x] examples
	[x] toc link?
	[x] figure out which to keep which to kill
	[x] figure out where to link these on homepage
	[x] check up on pixi/threejs sandboxes

[x] why is live-server refreshing on .git

[x] i don't like the way import export works
	it should reflect folder hierarchy somehow
	lest name collisions become nightmarish

[x] position/progress indicator on index/toc
[x] scroll toc item into view on scroll if highlighted section not visible
	[x] ...would be nice to include margin top of first h1

[x] remember how to deploy / update this monster

[x] are the mobile styles good? should they be on by default?
	"docked to bottom" vs "fatter controls for fingers not cursors" 
	(should these be coupled?)

stale todos from 2019

[x] i don't want to see that inline --max-height style until i've dragged

[ ] right click to reset sliders?
[x] vertical drag on number fields
